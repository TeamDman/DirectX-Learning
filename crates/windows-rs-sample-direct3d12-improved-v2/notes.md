I have used a lot of Windows API in my project, https://github.com/rustdesk/rustdesk/blob/master/src/platform/windows.rs, I would like to migrate to https://github.com/microsoft/windows-rs in the future.

I also write some C++ for lazy, https://github.com/rustdesk/rustdesk/blob/master/src/windows.cc

compile and link with cc crate, https://github.com/rustdesk/rustdesk/blob/master/build.rs#L3
